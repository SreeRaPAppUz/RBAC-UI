# **RBAC-UI: Admin Dashboard for Role-Based Access Control**  

## **Overview**  
RBAC-UI is a comprehensive admin dashboard that simplifies the management of **users**, **roles**, and **permissions** in any web application. Designed with both functionality and security in mind, it empowers administrators to efficiently control user access, define granular permissions, and monitor role assignments.  

Whether you’re managing a team, overseeing a complex organization, or securing sensitive data, RBAC-UI provides the tools necessary to enforce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with ease.

- **Python 3.8+**  
- **Django 4.0+**  
- **Node.js** (if frontend packages are required)  
- **PostgreSQL** (default database; can be substituted with others)  

### **Setup Instructions**  

#### **1. Clone the Repository**

        'PASSWORD': 'your_db_password',  
        'HOST': 'localhost',  
        'PORT': '5432',  
    }  
}  
```  

#### **5. Apply Migrations**  
```bash  
python manage.py makemigrations  
python manage.py migrate  
```  

#### **6. Create a Superuser**  
```bash  
python manage.py createsuperuser  
```  

#### **7. Start the Development Server**  
```bash  
python manage.py runserver  
```  
Visit the admin dashboard at:
